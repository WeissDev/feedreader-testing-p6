## Feedreader Testing

I completed this as the final project for the Udacity Frontend-Developer Nanodegree. I had to test a feedreader web app using <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a>, a behavior-driven framework for JavaScript testing. I implemented this framework by testing several aspects of the app's functions. You can have a look at it <a href="http://weissdev.github.io/feedreader-testing-p6/">here</a>.
